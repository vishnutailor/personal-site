      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I like building things that are useful and simple. At Arizona College
        Preparatory High School, I’ve grown from helping at local programs to
        organizing teams, budgets, and systems for clubs, nonprofits, and student
        ventures. A lot of my work sits at the intersection of business, community
        service, and basic analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I founded and lead our Red Cross chapter, where 250+ students have contributed
        thousands of volunteer hours through blood drives, donation campaigns, and
        health-focused service projects. I also serve as Vice-President of Interact
        Club, a Level III Investment Analyst with BYCIG, and a youth soccer referee,
        which keeps me grounded in communication, fairness, and clear decision-making
        on and off the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school, I’ve interned at firms and startups, helped build tools
        like Dental Buddy for DentAid, and worked on financial literacy programs with
        Project Coin. Each experience has pushed me to explain ideas clearly, test
        what actually works, and keep iterating.
